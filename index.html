        <p class="subtitle">Nick has been buying and selling fish for the past 20 years.  He also enjoys catching them when heâ€™s not working, ensuring his all round knowledge and wealth of experience in the industry is second to none!</p>
        <p>Nick provides fresh, seasonal fish and shellfish from the waters around the British Isles, with much of his stock coming from Llandudno, Conwy in Wales. He is also a regular early morning visitor to the Manchester Fish Market where he picks up Farm Shop favourites: Turbot, Brill, Lemon Sole and Monkfish (from Cornwall); Wild Salmon and Wild Sea Trout (from Northumberland); and Smoked Haddock (from Hull).</p>
